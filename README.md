"# Captcha-recognition" 
This project uses a multi-layer perceptron classifier to recognize captcha images from our university website (vtopbeta.vit.ac.in/vtop/#) with near-human accuracy.
File "untitled0.py" is the python code while files "X.npy" and "Y.npy" are the training data and corresponding labels respectively.
